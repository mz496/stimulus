Our first stretch is the Upper Back Release.<break time="1s"/>
 
Stand with your feet at a hip-distance apart.<break time="2s"/>
Clasp your hands in front of you and round your upper back by pushing them forward, keeping your arms straight.<break time="3s"/>
This stretches your upper back and the back of your shoulders.<break time="2s"/>
Hold this for 2-3 deep breaths.<break time="10s"/><break time="5s"/>

Our second stretch is the Seated Spinal Twist.<break time="1s"/>

Sit on a chair or the edge of your bed with your legs together.<break time="2s"/>
Twist your upper body to the left from the waist.<break time="3s"/>

This stretches your spine and shoulders. Hold this for 2-3 deep breaths.<break time="10s"/><break time="5s"/>

You know the drill, repeat on the other side for 2-3 more deep breaths.<break time="10s"/><break time="5s"/>

The third stretch is the Standing Hamstring Stretch.<break time="1s"/>
